This is a (Firefox) add-on (WebExtension) that emits a sound every time you connect to a service hosted by Google.

It is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/berthubert">@berthubert</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/berthubert/googerteller">googerteller</a> that you can use outside of your browser to do the same.
<strong>This is a fun project, don't take it too seriously!</strong>

<strong>Note:</strong> Find it ironic or not, but to query the list of all Google IPs/subnets, this needs to contact one Google domain, actually.
(That request does not emit a sound, though.)
